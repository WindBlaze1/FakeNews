# FakeNews #

Fake news is invalid and misleading information that is conveyed as accurate news. Fake news detection has become indispensable in modern society because of the extreme propagation of false news on social platforms and news portals. Several studies have been released that use fake news on social platforms instead of news content for decision-making.

## To solve this problem, I have: ##
*	Took a fake news dataset from Kaggle
*	Preprocessed the data and analyzed it using various methods
*	Implemented vectorizers (TF-IDF, GLOVE, BERT)
*	Trained various models (RNN, CNN, LSTM)
*	Selected the combination of vectorizer + model with the best accuracy
